# Automatic Car Parking System (College Mini Project)

This project is a simplified automatic car parking system developed as a mini-project during our college coursework. It simulates the basic functionality of a smart parking system, likely using sensors and microcontrollers (details depend on the specific implementation).

## Overview

The project aims to demonstrate the core concepts of an automated car parking system, typically including:

*   **Parking Space Detection:** Detecting the availability of parking spaces using sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors).
*   **Entrance/Exit Control:** Controlling the entry and exit of vehicles using gates or barriers.
*   **Display/Indication:** Displaying the number of available parking spaces or guiding drivers to available spots.
*   **(Potentially) Ticket Generation/Management:**  Generating and managing parking tickets (simplistic implementation likely).

**Note:** This is a simplified academic project and may not include all the features of a commercial-grade automatic parking system.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used will vary depending on the specific implementation, but common components likely include:

*   **Microcontroller:** Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or similar.
*   **Sensors:** Ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors, or other proximity sensors.
*   **Actuators:** Servo motors (for controlling gates/barriers), LEDs (for indication).
*   **Programming Language:** C/C++ (for Arduino), Python (for Raspberry Pi), or other relevant language.
*   **(Potentially) Display:** LCD screen, LEDs, or other display devices.
*   **(Potentially) Database:** If storing parking data, potentially a simple database (e.g., SQLite).

## Project Structure

The repository structure will depend on the hardware and software components used. Expect to find:

*   **Code:** Source code for the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino sketch) or Raspberry Pi.
*   **Schematics/Wiring Diagrams:** Diagrams showing how the sensors, actuators, and microcontroller are connected.
*   **Documentation:** Project report, presentation slides, or other documentation explaining the project's design and implementation.
*   **(Potentially) Libraries:** Any necessary libraries for the sensors or other hardware components.

## Setup and Usage

Due to the hardware-dependent nature of this project, specific setup instructions will vary greatly.  However, the general steps are:

1.  **Hardware Assembly:** Assemble the electronic components according to the provided schematics or wiring diagrams.
2.  **Software Installation:** Install the necessary software libraries and development environment (e.g., Arduino IDE, Python with relevant libraries).
3.  **Code Upload/Deployment:** Upload the code to the microcontroller or deploy it to the Raspberry Pi.
4.  **Calibration and Testing:** Calibrate the sensors and test the system's functionality.

**Important:** Refer to the project's documentation (if available) for detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting tips.  The quality and detail of these instructions will vary.

## Important Considerations

*   **Hardware Dependencies:** This project is heavily dependent on specific hardware components.  You'll need to acquire the necessary hardware and understand how to connect them correctly.
*   **Sensor Calibration:**  Accurate sensor calibration is crucial for reliable operation.
*   **Real-World Limitations:**  This is a simplified simulation and may not account for all the complexities of a real-world parking system (e.g., varying vehicle sizes, environmental factors).
*   **Safety:**  Be careful when working with electrical components.
*   **Documentation Quality:** The level of documentation provided may vary significantly.  Be prepared to troubleshoot and experiment.
